**Kali Linux :**

I have installed it in a VirtualBox. You can download the VB file from the downloads sections. Here is how you unzip it:
`brew install p7zip`
`7z e filName.7z`

The file output is for the virtualbox. Double click on it and it will launch. 
Default values are :
username: root
password : toor
